# Automated_Script
This is a Script that gets the following: Time, Date, News. It then compiles it into a website that is easy to read. The following is an example of how the output looks like. The Code uses Data Scraping tools and then puts all the data out to the website. It can be modified to output the text elsewhere as well.
